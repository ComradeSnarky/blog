        <p>I mean, it's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars? You are a worse psychiatrist than you are a son-in-law and you will never get work as an actor because you have no talent. I don't want no part of yo tight-ass country-club, ya freak bitch! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me. So you take your mom to work every day? Bummer. Moms are such a pain in the ass, huh? It's, like, die already!</p>

        <p>[climbing under trampoline] This shall keep me safe from the hot Mexican sun. First I blow him, then I poke him. And guess what else is back. [slow wink] My breakfast? My friskiness. Mama horny Michael. Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down. Maybe it was the other George Michael. You know, the singer-songwriter. The only thing I found in the fridge was a dead dove in a bag. It seems like only yesterday you were bursting forth from your mother's fertile womb.

        <p>It's ok. You be with Yam. There are dozens of us! Dozens! She's always got to wedge herself in the middle of us so that she can control everything. Yeah. Mom's awesome. Why are you squeezing me with your body? It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. It feels good to be back in a queen! In the mid '90s, Tobias formed a folk music band with Lindsay and Maebe which he called Dr. Funke's 100 Percent Natural Good Time Family Band Solution. The group was underwritten by the Natural Food Life Company, a division of Chem-Grow, an Allen Crayne acqusition, which was part of the Squimm Group. Their motto was simple: We keep you alive. A-coodle-doodle-doo. A-coodle-doodle-doo. We need a name. Maybe "Operation Hot Mother." No, let's try to top that. (They never did.)

      <p>Chuck Norris eats transformer toys in vehicle mode and poos them out transformed into a robot. If you can see Chuck Norris, he can see you. If you can’t see Chuck Norris you may be only seconds away from death. Chuck Norris used live ammunition during all shoot-outs. When a director once said he couldn’t, he replied, “Of course I can, I’m Chuck Norris,” and roundhouse kicked him in the face.

      <p>There is only one King. Filming on location for Walker: Texas Ranger, Chuck Norris brought a stillborn baby lamb back to life by giving it a prolonged beard rub. Shortly after the farm animal sprang back to life and a crowd had gathered, Chuck Norris roundhouse kicked the animal, breaking its neck, to remind the crew once more that Chuck giveth, and the good Chuck, he taketh away. If you have five dollars and Chuck Norris has five dollars, Chuck Norris has more money than you.

      <p>Chuck Norris was the fourth Wiseman. He brought baby Jesus the gift of “beard”. Jesus wore it proudly to his dying day. The other Wisemen, jealous of Jesus’ obvious gift favoritism, used their combined influence to have Chuck omitted from the Bible. Shortly after all three died of roundhouse kick related deaths. Chuck Norris knows where Carmen Sandiego is. Chuck Norris once tried to wear glasses. The result was him seeing around the world to the point where he was looking at the back of his own head.
